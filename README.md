Project Idea
Problem:
Wildfires in British Columbia have caused significant ecological and economic damage
and pose a threat to human life. As climate change intensifies, the frequency and severity of
wildfires are expected to worsen. Accurately assessing wildfire risk will allow for proactive
measures such as controlled burns, fuel breaks, public alerts, and fire bans. Our AI system will
classify wildfire risk across BC using satellite imagery and geographical data. These predictions
will support early warnings and more effective resource allocation for wildfire prevention and
response.


Our AI system will use supervised learning for wildfire risk classification. We will test
several methods (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting) including an ensemble
method and use whichever yields the best results. The model will take satellite imagery,
weather data, and geographical information as inputs, and output fire risk classifications into
five categories: Very Low, low, moderate, high, and Extreme risk. The results will then be
visualized as a heatmap overlay across British Columbia.
